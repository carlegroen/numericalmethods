#4: Bi-linear Interpolation on a Rectilinear Grid in Two Dimensions

Bi-linear interpolation is done by constructing a function that passes through given points. The n<sub>x</sub> * n<sub>y</sub> vectors are tabulated in the function F<sub>i,j</sub>, which denotes all points within the matrix.

The non-interpolated picture for part A is given as the contourplot below:
